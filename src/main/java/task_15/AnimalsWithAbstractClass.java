/**
 * Exercise 14: Create three interfaces, each with two methods. Inherit a new interface that combines the three, adding a new method.
 * Create a class by implementing the new interface and also inheriting from a concrete class.
 * Now write four methods, each of which takes one of the four interfaces as an argument.
 * In main( ), create an object of your class and pass it to each of the methods
 * <p>
 * Exercise 15: Modify the previous exercise by creating an abstract class and
 * inheriting that into the derived class.
